        I started working on music in 2020 in my 2nd year of college. I have
        since then made dozens of tracks, comprising of many genres. I've
        personally grown up on a lot of Bollywood, Punjabi Music and 2000-2010s
        Hip-Hop which serve as my inspiration for a lot of my music. My top 5
        Hip-Hop albums of all time are: Get Rich Or Die Trying, The Eminem Show,
        Still Here, Good vs Evil, Kamikaze. Some of my favorite artists
        currently are Kr$na, Sidhu Moosewala, SamaChaar, Eminem, KXNG CROOKED

      Here's the link to a song I produced, called 'Kaise Samjhau', by Shunya
      from his EP 'Adhuri Baatein)'.<br />
      It is a melodic Lo-Fi track where Shunya is speaking his heart out in
      memory of his lover.

      <br />
      My name is Amandeep Singh, you can call me Ace. Apart from making music, I
      am also a Computer Science Student at UCSC.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fun Fact: I made this webpage myself!
      <br />
      <br />
      I was born in Jammu, India (i.e. The Best Place In The World, I'm biased
      that way)
      <br />
      <br />
      I've grown up playing a lot of videogames, sports and reading a lot of
      books and I still do a lot of that. In fact, Here's a link to my
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132901224-ace">GoodReads</a>.
      Suggest me some good books.
      <br />
      <br />
      As for gaming, I'm currently playing Elden Ring or as I like to call it,
      Kill Me Already.
      <br />
      <br />
      And as for the sports, I'm backing MI in this edition of the IPL just like
      everytime.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some of my other interests include philosophy, comedy, sunsets. Yep,
      that's it.
      <br />
      <br />
      And here, is what I look like in case you want to make memes(Go at it.)
